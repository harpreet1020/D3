## Scatter 

* Using the  '2014 ACS 1-year estimates' data set, I created a scatter plot between two of the data variables ('Obesity vs income'). 
* The scatter plot represents each state with circle elements. Respective state abbreviations are included in each circle. This was accomplished using D3 techniques. 

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
